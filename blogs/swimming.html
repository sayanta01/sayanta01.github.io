	<h2> üåÑ My trip to Mukteshwar </h2>

	<div>
	
	<p> After spending more than a year in a dark room, I decided to visit mountains first time in my life. I was always excited to do these kind of </p>
<p> stuff. I chose this place Mukteshwar, a small district somewhere in Uttrakhand, India. I did my research and watched many vlogs. I wanted </p>
<p> to do all the normie stuff like making vlog and enjoying the views. I had lot of issues regarding my career choices. I just got graduated and ..... <p>
<p>I don't have any job currently. I also believed, I was getting bored with Computers a little. I had high hopes --that this trip will move me.

<p>How it went?</p>

<p>I don't like places with crowd, that's why I chose an underrated place with almost no tourist. It was two day trip. First day, I got really </p>
<p>excited, but second day it was depressing. That place made me silent, not internally but externally. I went with one of my friend, I prepared </p>
<p>lot of jokes to crack to target his self esteem. Some shitty vlog ideas to make. But that place was so silent, It made me silent. </p>

<p>Best Experience..</p>

<p>When I went to Mukteshwar. I was in a cottage, Almost every cool place of Mukteshwar was near to the cottage. The best place of that </p>
<p>place was "Chauli's Jali". It was the most highest altitude of Mukteshwar and had some edgy rocks. Perfect place to push someone into</p>
<p>death. But the view was amazing. When I first went at that place, It was horrible experience. It was evening and so many normie people</p>
<p>were talking. The only reason I chose to be on Mukteshwar is because I wanted peace. But those people were annoying. So I came back</p>
<p>early and made a plan. Next morning at 5AM in dark, I forced my friend to go to that place, He was terrified (dark + forest) but I was</p>
<p>excited. He even tried to abandon me but I started going alone, through jungle at dark. I just wanted to own that place. But then he followed</p>
<p>and we went to that same place again, but this time. It was dawn and dayum whole Mukteshwar lights were like stars. I had stars on top and</p>
<p>bottom both. We sat on the most edgy rock and enjoyed the peace.</p>

<p>Waterfall Experience..</p>

<p>Mukteshwar also have a famous waterfall. Which was very far away from our cottage. But we had car, so we decided to visit. We did 800M</p>
<p>treking to visit that place and then I ended up again with crowd. The issue is not people. The issue is "They are annoying". Every person just</p>
<p>wanted a perfect click. I don't understand how a person can use phone at such a beautiful place. I hate these "in cells" people. I can't ignore</p>
<p>them and I ended up just sitting in the corner and being fly on the wall. While my phone was switched off in my bag. I am not against</p>
<p>clicking photos, I clicked few too. But I don't like trying to click a perfect picture of me in front of every nice thing I see. I just click a single</p>
<p>pic of something, I find cool. I never try hard to take the best picture. Because I have internet (I can search the exact place pic in 4k).</p>

<p>Sunset</p>

<p>One thing I realized after this trip is, people really don't enjoy the place they visit. They just want to increase the number of places they visit.</p>
<p>My way of traveling was very different. I never pressurized myself to see everything. I just enjoyed, what I had. For example - I knew about</p>
<p>a church in Mukteshwar. So I went there, it was close but dayum the sunset behind that church was so beautiful. I just spend whole evening
<p>on that one spot.</p>

<p>My love for Darkness</p>

<p>Unlike others I enjoyed Mukteshwar more at Night, My friend called me crazy for that. Because I wanted to go to Jungle in</p>
<p>Night. But he forced me to stayed near the road. But I have to say, that place had peace, which we city people can't imagine.</p>
<p>Looking at the dark jungle in complete dark. Beathing fresh air and absolute silence was amazing.

<p>A Dog</p>

<p>I am not an animal person, I don't like dogs or cats. But in Mukteshwar, every dog was very silent. This is the nature of</p>
<p>animals in hill areas. I was sitting in the most edgy rock of one of the most highest mountain of Mukteshwar and suddenly a</p>
<p>silent dog came next to me. Obviously I can't explain the moment I had with that thing. But it was cool the way he tried to be</p>
<p>friend. No pick up line like "woof". I was lucky he came silently, because I was on the edge. I really loved the way he offered</p>
<p>a friendship. He walked with us back to jungle whole way followed us, until we reached a temple. That dog my friend is</p>
<p>r/animalbeingbros.</p>


<p>My thoughts while returning.</p>

<p>I really believed, I am 18 and I don't need this amount of peace. I want rush, thrill and adventure. It's sad but now I realized, I</p>
<p>was not completely disconnected from society and people. Technology connected me in a wrong way. But I need it. I got urge</p>
<p>to use computers again and play games again. I wanted to use my computer all night and listen to loud music. The peace of</p>
<p>Mukteshwar is cool, But I felt like, I will enjoy that peace more after some big battles in life.</p>
